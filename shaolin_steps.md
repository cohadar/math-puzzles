# Shaolin Steps

A Shaolin monk lives in a mountain temple. There are ```n``` steps that lead to the temple, the temple floor is the n-th step.
Every morning monk practices by running up and down the steps in a specific pattern.

There is a stone Buddha carved in the mountain side whose outstretched hand marks exactly halfway up the steps. Number of steps can be either even or odd, so Buddha's hand is either pointing at the middle step, or at the border between two steps.

Monk starts every morning by saying a prayer at the temple floor looking down the steps. After prayer monk starts running down the steps. When he passes the stone Buddha's hand, he turns around and runs back to the temple floor. Than he turns around once more and runs all the way down to the bottom of the steps, and finally turns around and runs all the way up to the temple floor.

When monk runs down he jumps ```4``` steps at a time.
When monk runs up he jumps ```3``` steps at a time.

Every morning monk makes ```99``` jumps.
How many steps does the temple have?
